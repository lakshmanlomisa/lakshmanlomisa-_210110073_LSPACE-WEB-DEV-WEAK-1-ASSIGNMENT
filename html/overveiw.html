        <h2>History</h2>
        <p><strong>Origins:</strong> The origins of soccer can be traced back over 2,000 years to ancient civilizations in China, Greece, and Rome, where various forms of kicking games were played.</p>
        <p><strong>Modern Soccer:</strong> The modern version of the sport as we know it today started in England in the 19th century. The Football Association (FA) was founded in 1863, which established standardized rules and organized the first official competitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Global Spread:</strong> Soccer quickly spread around the world, becoming particularly popular in Europe, South America, and Africa. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was established in 1904 to oversee international competitions.</p>

        <h2>Basic Rules and Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The primary objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.</p>
        <p><strong>Players:</strong> Each team has 11 players, including a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player allowed to use their hands and arms, but only within the penalty area.</p>
        <p><strong>Field:</strong> Soccer is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The field's dimensions can vary, but the standard size is about 100-110 meters long and 64-75 meters wide.</p>
        <p><strong>Game Duration:</strong> A standard match consists of two halves, each 45 minutes long, with a 15-minute halftime break. If the game is tied at the end of regular time, additional time or a penalty shootout may be used in certain competitions to determine a winner.</p>
        <p><strong>Starting and Restarting Play:</strong> The game begins with a kickoff from the center circle. Play is restarted with a kickoff after a goal, and various other methods (throw-in, goal kick, corner kick, free kick) are used to restart play when the ball goes out of bounds or a foul is committed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Scoring:</strong> A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the goal line between the goalposts and beneath the crossbar. Each goal is worth one point.</p>
