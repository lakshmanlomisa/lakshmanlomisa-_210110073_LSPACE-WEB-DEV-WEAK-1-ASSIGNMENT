        <h2>Equipment Needed</h2>
        <ul class="equipment-list">
            <li><strong>Soccer Ball:</strong> The fundamental piece of equipment. Soccer balls come in different sizes: Size 3 for young children, Size 4 for youth players, and Size 5 for adults.</li>
            <li><strong>Soccer Cleats:</strong> Special shoes with studs or spikes on the soles to provide better traction on the field.</li>
            <li><strong>Shin Guards:</strong> Essential for protecting your shins from kicks and collisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Soccer Socks:</strong> Long socks that cover the shin guards and offer additional cushioning.</li>
            <li><strong>Soccer Jersey and Shorts:</strong> Comfortable, breathable clothing suitable for running and physical activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Goalkeeper Gloves (for goalkeepers):</strong> Gloves with padding to protect the hands and improve grip on the ball.</li>

        <h2>Basic Strategies</h2>
        <ul class="strategy-list">
            <li><strong>Passing and Moving:</strong> Always look to pass the ball to a teammate in a better position. After passing, move to an open space to receive the ball again.</li>
            <li><strong>Maintaining Possession:</strong> Keep the ball under control with short, accurate passes. Avoid long, high-risk passes that can lead to turnovers.</li>
            <li><strong>Defensive Positioning:</strong> Stay between the ball and your goal. Mark opponents closely and try to anticipate their movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Attacking Plays:</strong> Use quick, precise passes and runs to create scoring opportunities. Stretch the opposing defense by using the width of the field.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Pieces:</strong> Practice free kicks, corner kicks, and throw-ins to take advantage of these opportunities to score or create chances.</li>
        </ul>
